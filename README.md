# DeepGCF
DeepGCF learns the functional conservation between pig and human based on the epigenome profiles from two species. It can be applied to pairwise comparisons of any two species given their epigenome profiles sequence alignments.

## Human-pig DeepGCF score
DeepGCF scores for human (GRCh38) and pig (susScr11) are available [here](https://farm.cse.ucdavis.edu/~liangend/DeepGCF/). In the human bed file, each window has a unique score, but in the pig bed file, there are overlapping windows (the same region may have multiple scores) because the input sequence alignment is generated using human genome as the basis, which could align to multiple segments of pig genome.
